    "1. Double all the elements in A, store the result in A itself.\n",
    "2. Calculate the matrix multiplication A times B, store it as D.\n",
    "3. Consider C to be a column vector and add it to the right of A. Show the result without storing it. \n",
    "4. Transpose B and add it to the bottom of A (as extra rows).\n",
    "5. Add B to itself, store the result as E.\n",
    "6. Add C to itself as a new row (considering C now to be a row vector), and store the result in F. The results should be a 2x3 matrix.\n",
    "7. Calculate the element-wise multiplication between F and B.\n",
    "8. Calculate the element-wise multiplication between C and B (this will result in using numpy broadcasting).\n",
    "9. Change the shape of C to be a 3x1 array, store it as G. Change the shape of C to be a 1x3 array, store it as H.\n",
    "10. Calculate the element-wise multiplication between G and H (note that numpy will broadcast now in two dimensions).\n",
